bugs:
	x - 1 some time fd is kept open and not released why
			fixed by return 0 from read, write and readwrite
	x 2 opening a file first time ( if remote is there and no cache in /tmp ) gives fail result but actually cache is created ( But not opened )
			fixed by checking all conditins about file not there and reopening after downloading 
	x 3 echo "asmita asmita" > asmitajunk from the mountdir gives bash: Function not implemented ? 
			fixed by implementig return 0 from open
	x 4 echo "asmita asmita" > mountdir/asmitajunk from the ../mountdir gives file not found error
			same as 3

TODO
	- ammifs.c:	// TODO main(): mkdir -p /tmp/localroot hardcoded , use passed argument instead
	- handle case where scp failed but 0 byte file is created and localroot
	- ammifs.c:   // TODO  do_open() stat updated for the entry if copied from the remote machine
	- ammifs.c:	// TODO do_release: can sync up directory entry with remotestat


	x - ammifs.c:	// TODO do_release: case for WRONLY do we write back  - yes already done
			completed
	x - ammifs.c:	// TODO do_release(): non read, non writeonly and non readwrite case : implement writeback
			completed and handled


deferred
	- ammifs.c:	// TODO do_release: need to implement unlink the .cached file on last reference removed. ( or last close or can we just keep it? )
	- ammifs.c:   /* TODO getxattr not implemented yet*/
